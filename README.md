Continuous Zero-Downtime Deployments for Kubernetes & Istio

A poor man's Kubernetes-native [Spinnaker](https://www.spinnaker.io/)

Named after [Theseus's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus):

> does an object that has had all of its components replaced remain fundamentally the same object?

## About

Perform continually-tested and monitored roll-outs to a Kubernetes microservice application.

Testing is a primary design concern:
1. a "dark canary" deployment is made alongside an existing application
1. test traffic is routed to it using `routerules` dynamic request routing
1. if the canary passes its functional and performance tests then `routerule` weight is gradually scaled up, taking load from the previous version
1. if any test metric falls below expected tolerance, the `routerule`'s weight is scaled to zero, with the previous version (that hasn't been scaled down) picking up the traffic
1. *todo:* as traffic is scaled up, functional and performance tests are persistently re-run

Test invocations are currently implemented as script hooks.

This project is currently in *alpha*, feedback and PRs welcome.

# Sequence

Currently missing from diagram:

- performance tests
- traffic scale up

![Sequence Diagram](./sequence-diagram.png)


# TODO

- Rewrite prototype in go
- Configurable polling interval aka disable turbo-mode
- Normalise `precedence` upon deploy to avoid constant increments
- Move to an operator
- Allow webhooks for tests
- Improve journaling, audit and state
- Integrate with prometheus
- Provide YAML deployment flow templates
- Permit run without sidecar bypass
- Move test suite to sockshop (reviews is JVM and flaky)

rolling red/black, validation gates, %ages: 1, 5, 25, 50 100
canary: common measurements, underlying metrics, cpu/mem profiling, latency, error codes
  - acceptable deviations
  - canary sample at 1%, 50%, 100%
  - mitigating measures without losing velocity
